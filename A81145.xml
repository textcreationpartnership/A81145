            <title>Culpeper's last legacy left and bequeathed to his dearest wife, for the publicke good, being the choicest and most profitable of those secrets which while he lived were lockt up in his breast, and resolved never to be publisht till after his death. Containing sundry admirable experiences in severall sciences, more especially, in chyrurgery and physick, viz. compounding of medicines, making of waters, syrrups, oyles, electuaries, conserves, salts, pils, purges, and trochischs. With two particular treatises; the one of feavers; the other of pestilence; as also other rare and choice aphorisms, fitted to the understanding of the meanest capacities. Never publisht before in any of his other works. By Nicholas Culpeper, late student in astrology and physick.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This Diſeaſe is cauſed through inordinate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Vapours that are windy,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> contained in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts of the Brain; this Diſeaſe is cauſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the Brain it ſelfe is ill-affected, or of Vapours aſcending from the Stomack thither; the Braine it ſelfe is offended by a Humour aeriall, from whence a windy ſpirit moveth inordinately about, and troubleth the apprehenſion; ſo that all things the man ſeeth, ſeeme to turne round alſo; the Brain is offended by the mouth of the Stomack, when windy exhalations are carried from thence to the Brain, which happeneth by corruption or putrefaction in the Stomack, the Vapours of which being penetrating move about the Brain.</p>

                        </gap> of a Vertigo;</hi> of ſome <hi>Scotoma:</hi> and this, ſay they, is the moſt dangerous, becauſe it often turns to the Falling-ſickneſſe. Indeed I grant, the dark Vertigo turneth ſooneſt to the Falling-ſickneſſe, becauſe it commeth of <hi>Atra bilis,</hi> or Choler aduſt: but <hi>Fuchſius</hi> thinks they erre that think the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to be two, becauſe they differ a Tittle in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and truly ſo do I. All <hi>Gallen's</hi> words may not be Authenticks; no, nor <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his neither: and neither <hi>Fuchſius</hi> nor my ſelf were nor are ſo ſimple, but we know Choler yellow, will turn black, and aduſt in the Tunicle of the Stomack, and cauſe no other difference then changing the quality, not the nature of the Diſeaſe. But enough of this; I proceed to the Signs.</p>
                  <p>A darknes or miſt appeareth before their eys that are troubled with this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and that upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light occaſion, eſpecially if they drink but a cup of ſtrong drink, or wine; or if they turn round: for it chanceth to them if they turn round once, as it doth to others when they turn round often times, ſo that ſometimes they fall down. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſame effect it brings to him, to ſee another man, or a wheel, or the water run round: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let ſuch objects be avoided; for the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits beholding it, turn about alſo, and ſo the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Humour that cauſeth the Diſeaſe, is troubled, unequall and inordinate.</p>
                  <p>When this Diſeaſe lyeth in the brain only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to the ſtomack, there followeth ſound in the ears, pain in the head, ſometimes vehement, and heavineſſe there; alſo the ſmelling and other ſenſes are detrimented: their fits are chiefly when the Sun doth heat them, or when their head is hot by ſome other means: for Heat doth diſſolve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169989:15"/>the Humours, and then they turne about the Brain.</p>
                  <p>And indeed for ought I know, a cleer Sun-ſhine day is hurtfull for thoſe in whom the Diſeaſe proceeds from the Stomack, as mine did; and I found the ſame extreamly prejudiciall to me.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe in whom the Diſeaſe proceedeth from the Stomack, feel a gnawing in their Stomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fit come, and a diſpoſition to vomit, and are as though they were heart-burnt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alſo thus you may know of what Humour the Diſeaſe</hi> ☞ <hi>comes, by the apparent colour of things to their eyes:</hi> for if they appear yellow, the Diſeaſe comes of yellow Choler: <hi>if reddiſh or bloody, it comes of Blood, and is</hi> ☞ <hi>apt to fall into a frenzy or madneſſe; if dark, it comes of</hi> Atra bilis, <hi>and is a fore-runner of the Falling ſickneſſe,</hi> ☞ <hi>or Apoplexie.</hi> And thus much for example ſake.</p>
                  <p>Alſo theſe Diſeaſes are moſt violent in that time of the year that ſuiteth beſt with their nature; as Choler in Summer, Melancholy in Autumn, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If this Diſeaſe be cauſed by Vapours that aſcend from the Stomack,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> as mine did, Vomiting is a ſpeedy cure, and the onely cure I could find.</p>

                  <p>A word to ſatisfie the curious, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> as well as that of ſenſe, flowes from the brain, as from the fountaine, and is derived from thence by the nerves to the inſtruments of ſenſe and motion; and ſo either ſenſe or motion is loſt, according as the ſinews that convey ſenſe or motion are affected in the diſeaſe; therefore it being conſidered that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169989:21"/>divers members participate in two kinds of ſinews; the one for ſenſe, the other for motion,<note place="margin">I doe not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this.</note> the doubt is eaſily cleered.

                  <p>If members participate but of one ſinew, as few do, (perhaps none) yet <hi>Gallen</hi> ſaith ſome do, and at preſent I cannot contradict him;<note place="margin">I rather adhear to this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> leſſe vertue is required for feeling then for motion, ſaith he; and ſo if the ſinew be much hurt, ſenſe and motion are both loſt; if it be but little hurt, onely motion is loſt.</p>
                  <p>The matter indeed is ſcarce worth diſputing for, or writing of, and therefore I proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Original of this diſeaſe lies ſometimes in the Brain,<note place="margin">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ſometimes in the marrow of the backe.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169989:35"/>mutation, or ſenſible change, and may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a conſtant or ſtable Feaver.</p>
                  <p>Of this are three ſorts; I deſcribed them in the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p>This Feaver is cauſed by the rotting of all the humours equally within the Veſſels,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and eſpecially in the great Veſſels about the arm-holes and ſhare. and this chanceth, when fervent heat is kept in by violent binding and ſtopping, which is within the body; for when heat and moiſt things cannot breath out, they putrifie and rot preſently.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this feaver is ſeldome ingendred in thin ſpare folke, nor in cold bodies, nor old age, but in ſuch as abound in blood, of groſſe, fat, or fleſhy bodies, or ſtuffed with hot excrements.</p>
                  <p>This is properly known from <hi>Synochus non putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Signes.</note> becauſe there are ſignes of rottenneſſe in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and the pulſe of a man ſicke of this, but not ſo in the former.</p>
                  <p>The other ſignes all agree with the former.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this feaver | muſt begin with blood-letting,<note place="margin">Cure. Bleeding.</note> and that in the beginning of the diſeaſe, if you can.</p>
                  <p>Cold drinke is moſt perilous in this diſeaſe;<note place="margin">Caution.</note> firſt becauſe it cauſeth obſtructions, and hindreth the attenuation of the clammy humours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, cold drinkes hurt weake members; ſome by drinking cold drinke in this feaver, have gotten ſuch ſore throats|, that they could not ſwallow; in ſome the Stomacke is hurt, that they could not digeſt; in ſome the Bladder; generally that part that is weakeſt is moſt ſubject to hurt; and being hurt, cannot performe its proper office.</p>
                  <p>But blood-letting you may uſe at any time, if ſtrength permit, provided it be not upon a full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:169989:35"/>
                  <p>Such as have this feaver, have alwayes looſneſſe and ſometimes vomit up Choler.</p>
                  <p>Let his drinke be barly water,<note place="margin">Diake.</note> ſweetned with ſyrrup of Violets, and a little Oyle of Vitrioll to make it tart.</p>
                  <p>Let his diet be light of digeſtion,<note place="margin">Meat.</note> and let him eat it at his uſuall times of eating; for then it will digeſt beſt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Oranges, Lemmons, Oxymel, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juyce, are medicinall for him.</p>

                  <p>This Diſeaſe is cauſed two wayes.<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169989:60"/>owne experience in Phyſicke, as I have done before them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cauſe threefold.</note>The cauſes of this diſeaſe are three, yet all ſubſervient, the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>The firſt cauſe, is the great conjunctions of the ſuperiour Planets meeting in Signes; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Cauſe </seg>1</label> ruling ſuch and ſuch Countries and Cities, or in Signes oppoſing, or ſquaring ſuch Signes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a corrupted, and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Aire, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Cauſe </seg>2</label> which is cauſed by ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Planets.</p>
                  <p>The third is putrified humours, hot blood, adduſt, and burned, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Cauſe </seg>3</label> cauſed by breathing in ſuch corrupt Aire; and if the diet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were perverſe, it addes fuell to the fire, and fills the body with ſuperfluous humours.</p>
                  <p>A word or two now to ſatisfie men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the common feare of infection, which makes many rich men, which might and ought to maintaine poore viſited people, yea many Phyſicians, whoſe duties it is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter phyſick to them, to fly away, ſo that in time of great infection, you may heare more cry out for lack of bread, and meanes neceſſary, then for anguiſh of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:169989:61"/>
                  <p>Hence alſo came that unnaturall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane cuſtome of ſhutting up houſes that are viſited, thereby ſadding and dejecting their ſpirits; and thereby making way for the diſeaſe, as I ſhall ſhew anon; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men from their uſuall imployments, which is a digeſter of humours, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of health; Nay if the diſeaſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious (as in their opinions it is) it is plaine murder, to ſhut men up in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and mortall Aire.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall prove by ſollid arguments,<note place="margin">The Plague not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious. Arg. 1.</note> that the Peſtilence is not infectious.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Argument I frame thus.</p>
                  <p>That diſeaſe that infecteth one man that commeth neere it, infecteth all men that come neere it.</p>
                  <p>But the Plague infecteth not all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it infecteth none.</p>
                  <p>The minor is cleer, as the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>My Major I prove from the univerſal courſe of nature; The fire warmeth one man, it warmeth all; the water wetteth one man, it wetteth all, becauſe their nature is ſo to do; a ſword woundeth one man, it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that are ſtrooke with it; the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall current of nature runneth ſo; therefore the Plague, if it infect one man, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, all mens bodies are not full of humours; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> if they were, all would be infected.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, then by my Oppoſites argument, the fault lies in the humours that are within <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:169989:61"/>the body, not in the infection which is without; if he fly, will theſe putrified hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours continue in his body, and he remain in health? if ſo, how then come diſeaſes?</p>
                  <p>Or will an infected Aire change a diſeaſe, (which would be but bad at the beſt) if ſo, ſhew a Rule in Phyſick, and I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.<note n="*" place="margin">You may find ſome notable proofes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in my Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But clenſe the body of theſe humours, let all men do ſo, and then come to a viſited perſon, and then by my Oppoſites own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they will not be infected; and how then can the diſeaſe be infections, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no body.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Argument I frame thus.</p>
                  <p>That diſeaſe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> the raining of which may be fore-ſeene, by more ſecret cauſes in nature long before it come, can not be increaſed by viſiting the ſick, nor diminiſhed by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from them.</p>
                  <p>But the Peſtilence may, and always is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene long before it comes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you will have it never the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by viſiting thoſe that are ſick of it, nor eſcape ever a whit the longer, by abſtaining from it.</p>
                  <p>The Major is cleere; for if the cauſe come, the effect muſt needes follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Signs of a Plague to come.</note>For the proofe of the minor, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce twelve ſignes of a Plague to come, which appeare ſome of them above a yeare, yea ſome of them above two yeares before it come.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Phanomena</hi> in the Aire, great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169989:62"/>meetings of ſuperiour Planets, whereby not only the time, but alſo the place where the Peſtilence will moſt rage, may be gathered, as this Autumnall Peſtilence in <hi>London.</hi> 1645. was by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is the changing of the ſeaſons, hot weather out of its ſeaſon, and cold out of its ſeaſon, hot and dry weather a long time, upon ſouth winds, and many raines upon North-windes.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The ſixt is, when women conceived with child, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> do ſuffer abortion for every light and ſlight cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh is when in ſummer time after raine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> abundance of frogs of diverſe colours gather together.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The eight is a great number (more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169989:62"/>of flies, ſpiders, and creeping things, are ſeene in the ſpring.</p>

                  <p>Some lay Venice Treacle to it, and with good ſucceſſe;<note place="margin">Venice Treacle attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</note> for Venice Treacle draweth the poyſon to it, and doth not caſt it from it, as ſome Phyſicians ignorantly affirme; for proofe of which conſider, that all hot things are of an Attractive quality; Treacle is hot, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg: </seg>1</label> therefore Actractive. All purges draw the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to them, and having gotten it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nature caſts it out; for Rhubarbe, that purgeth choler, is purely Cholericke it ſelf, and therefore draws its like; ſo Venice Treacle draws the venemous humour to it ſelfe, and having gotten it into the tunicle of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, or other place farre from the Vitals, nature will deale well enough with it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Attractive faculty be hot, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg: </seg>2</label> and drie, then muſt all hot and drie things be attractive; But the attractive faculty is hot and drie.</p>

                  <p>But the originall and roote of all heate is attractive, as the Sun; ſo then are the Branches.</p>
                  <p>But enough (perhaps too much) of this.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the ſwelling falls downe again, and blacke, and that comes through cold taken, and is a deſperate ſigne; for you muſt be very carefull of taking cold, in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But when it is too late to prevent, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is preſently to take a Pigeon, and with a ſharpe knife, cut her through the breaſt to the back; break her open, and apply her (yet alive) to the place.</p>
                  <p>If this do no good, apply a Cupping-glaſs to the place; for though this remedy be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, yet I have knowne it ſave a mans life.</p>
                  <p>When the ſore is broken, apply a Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot plaiſter to it, and tent it with <hi>Linimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Arcei;</hi> and make no great haſte to heal it up.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if tokens appeare, (which by moſt ignorant people is affirmed,<note place="margin">Tokens.</note> and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be an infallible ſigne of death; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know two living at this time, and four or five more, ſince the writing of this in <hi>London,</hi> that were full of them, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;) firſt I will tell you what I knew my ſelfe; a young man was let blood after he had the tokens upon him, whereby part of the corrupted blood was let out, and the reſt cooled, and he lived above a fortnight
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169989:66"/>after, and then died; his Father denying to let him have any Phyſick in all that time, becauſe he ſaid he was marked for death; whereas Cordialls, and nouriſhing diet, might happily have preſerved his life.</p>
                  <p>Another remedy for thoſe that have tokens, is ſomething more deſperate, which is this; whilſt naturall heate remaines, wrap him up naked in a blanquet wet in cold water; and that will ſet him in a moſt violent ſweate, and purge out the corruption from the blood.</p>
